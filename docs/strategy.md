# TFT Tocker's Trials — Strategy Guide

## Scoring Formula (per round, 30 rounds total)
- **Unused component on bench: 2,500 pts × rounds remaining** ← dominates everything
- Surviving champion: 250 pts × rounds remaining
- Close call (win with exactly 1 champion alive): 5,000 pts
- Gold interest: 1,000 pts × interest tier × rounds remaining
- Star-up: 1,000 pts one-time bonus per star-up
- Time bonus: ~2,750 pts average per round

## The #1 Rule
Never build items from components unless the player will lose a life without them.
A single component held for 20 remaining rounds = 50,000 pts. No item is worth that.

## Economy
- Interest tiers: 0g at <10, 1g at 10, 2g at 20, 3g at 30, 4g at 40, 5g at 50+
- Maximize gold held at end of each round to maximize interest score
- Rerolling and leveling both cost gold — only recommend if it prevents a life loss

## Enemy Boards
- All enemy boards are fixed and known in advance (loaded from database)
- Rounds 1-2 are minion rounds
- Boss rounds: 1-10, 2-10, 3-10
- Augment rounds: 1-5, 2-5, 3-5 (Gold/Gold/Prismatic)

## Lives
- Player starts with 3 lives
- Losing all 3 ends the run
- Preserving lives matters only insofar as losing = losing future component/interest scoring
